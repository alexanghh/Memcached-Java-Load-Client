-Overview
-========
-
-It is difficult to decide which system is right for your application,
-partially because the features differ between systems, and partially
-because there is not an easy way to compare the performance of one
-system versus another.
-
-The goal of the YCSB project is to develop a framework and common set
-of workloads for evaluating the performance of different "key-value"
-and "cloud" serving stores. The project comprises two things:
-
-* The YCSB Client, an extensible workload generator
-
-* The Core workloads, a set of workload scenarios to be executed by
-  the generator
-
-Although the core workloads provide a well rounded picture of a
-system's performance, the Client is extensible so that you can define
-new and different workloads to examine system aspects, or application
-scenarios, not adequately covered by the core workload. Similarly, the
-Client is extensible to support benchmarking different
-databases. Although we include sample code for benchmarking HBase and
-Cassandra, it is straightforward to write a new interface layer to
-benchmark your favorite database.
-
-A common use of the tool is to benchmark multiple systems and compare
-them. For example, you can install multiple systems on the same
-hardward configuration, and run the same workloads against each
-system. Then you can plot the performance of each system (for example,
-as latency versus throughput curves) to see when one system does
-better than another.
-
-Detailed information about using the benchmark is available in the
-doc/index.html file.
